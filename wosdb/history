=============


v0.5    03-Jun-17
        o New command 'c' to catch any exception in the system. The
          catched task can be debugged normaly thereafter. Although a
          PPC task started inside a CLI will not terminate until the
          CLI is closed (which is a problem in WarpOS).
        o Fixed TBL and TBU in register display.
        o Updated to PPC disassembler module V1.6.


V0.4c	10-Mar-01
	o An access to 0x00000004 caused a DSI exception, which has to
	  be emulated by the WarpUp kernel. An ugly side-effect is, that
	  currently the instruction directly following this access can't
	  be traced and will be skipped in trace-mode.
	o New PPC disasssembler module 1.3, which fixes float-instructions
	  with four operands (the last two ones were swapped).


V0.4b	09-Nov-00
	o New PPC disassembler module V1.2, which fixes mffs, mtfsf, mtfsfi.


V0.4a	05-Mar-00
	o HUNK_RELOC32SHORT or HUNK_DREL32 hunks are correctly recognized
	  now. Before the symbols disappeared, when your executable
	  contained such a hunk (which happened often with StormC or
	  PowerAsm generated executables).


V0.4	26-Feb-00
	o Fixed symbol names shown as return address during stack
	  frame trace-back.


V0.3c	19-Feb-00
	o New PPC disassembler module V1.1, which recognizes fabs.


V0.3b	30-Jan-00
	o Year 2000 update.
	o Using new PPC disassembler module V1.0, which fixes the
	  instructions stfsx, lfdx, etc..


V0.3a	07-May-99
	o '?' command is no longer repeatable by hitting return.
	o Support for arguments. They may be specified behind the
          program name.
	o Compatible to StormC/PPC.
	o "@_..." and "@x..." symbol names are recognized.


V0.3	04-May-99
	o Fixed/enhanced task-termination notification. It's completely
	  done on PPC side now. The debugged task will immediately exit,
	  when the final "blr" was executed.
	o 'S' shows all symbols.


V0.2	02-May-99
	o Disassembly and memory dump display only valid memory regions.
	o Command 'tb' shows stack frame trace-back.


V0.1	01-May-99
	First usable version. There are no known bugs besides
	running into a WOS-exception, when disassembling or watching
	memory at an illegal address.
	The following features are implemented:
	- change PC to next/previous instruction
	- show help
	- arithmetic expression evaluation, which supports constants,
	  symbols and register-contents
	- changing GP- and FP-registers
	- loading and unloading of WarpOS programs
	- breakpoints (set, clear, temporary)
	- disassembler with symbol support
	- memory dump with symbol support
	- single-step trace
	- trace to next instruction
	- show all registers
	- exit debugger


V0.0	17-Apr-99
	Project started.
